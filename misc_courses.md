- Tools
    - impacket
        - Python library for working with network protocols
    - CrackMapExec
        - Designed for Windows envs
        - RCE, lateral movement and vuln assessment
        - Credential theft, pass-the-hash, network recon and security assessment
    - LOLBAS - Living Off the Land
        - Legit binaries on the system
        - Eg. Sysinternals, powershell
- Password dumping
    - Requires elevated privileges
    - `lsass.exe` process stores sensitive auth info
    - mimikatz can be used to extract passwords from the `lsass.exe` process
        - Requires admin privileges
    - Employing MitM or network interception to catch auth details in motion
- Anti-Virus evasion
    - DLL injection - load malicious DLL into legitimate process
        - Execute code within a trusted process
        - Leverages process hollowing or DLL injection
    - Process injection - Inject malicious code into a running process on target system
        - Leverages DLL injection, code injection and thread execution hijacking
    - Disabling AV process
        - Terminate process, disable service, modifying the AV settings or tampering with the signatures/scan config
    - Execution through system calls
        - Helps evade signature-based detection
        - Leverages low-level system functions to execute malicious code
