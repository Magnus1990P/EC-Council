Disclaimer: 

## Chapter 1 - Intro to NIST SP 800-53
- Common ground
    - Knowledge pre-requisites from FIPS-199, NIST-800-12, NIST-800-37
    - Basic security principles (CIA, euth, least-privilege, risk assessment)
    - FIPS-199
        - Framework for categories
        - Impact - Low medium high
        - Impact factor - Confidentiality, Integrity, availablity
        - Categorizing 
            1. Identify IS: HW, people, software, network, data
            1. Identify information types
            1. Impact level of CIA (Low medium high)
            1. Combining impact level into combinatory value
    - NIST RMF 800-37 - sets forth
        1. Categorize system
        1. Select: Select controls for system
        1. Implement: necessary controls for the system
        1. Assessment: verify the efficacy if the implemented controls, and address issues
        1. Authorize: Authorize the system for production setting based on the requiorements are met, but this is a continuous process
        1. Monitor: Process for monitoring the securityu controls, periodic security assessment
- NIST timeline
    - 2005 - Initial release of comprehensive set of security controls for federal systems
    - 2008 - Revision 2 - updated control catalog, control families, special controls for environments
    - 2009 - expanded the scope beyon federal systems
    - 2013 - privacy controls and new control framework
    - 2020 - revision 5 - security, privacy control and risk management
- Security controls are safeguards to protect CIA
- Privacy controls are safeguards to manage privacy risk and ensure compliance
- Questions
    - What controls are needed to satisfy requirements and risks
    - Are selected controls implemented or is there a plan for implementation
    - What level of assurance is required to verify the efficacy of selected controls
- NIST SP 800-53 - Purpose
    - Establish controls for systems & organisations that process, store or transmit information
    - Introduces security and privacy controls
    - Establishes common language for security, privacy and risk management
    - Facilitates a controls framework, independent of th process employed to select the controls
    - Combined control catalog and risk-based selection help comply with security and privacy requirments
- NIST SP 800-53 - Target
    - Everyone with management responsibilities, developers, administrators and auditors
- NIST SP 800-53 - Key components
    - Relationship between Requirements and Controls
    - Requirement - Capability requirement and Specification requirement
    - Controls - Safeguards and protection capabilties
    - Controls - Techincal/Administrative/Physical controls



## Chapter 2 - Key control families
1. Function of Controls
2. Neutrality of controls
3. Importance of understanding: Policy, Technology & Sector
4. Benefits of a neutral control catalog
5. Extra protection measures, beyond single controls
    - Some protection measures require multiple controls
6. Control evolution
    - Control catalog changes based on the threat landscape
7. Withdrawal of controls
    - Removal of ineffective controls or merging of multiple controls
8. Development of new controls
    - New controls introduced due to new regulations or new threats
9. Adjusting level of infosec and privacy
- There is a finite list of control families, along with generic category
    - The Major control families and objective describes the objective of a control family


#### Case studies and implementation 1
- Multi-branch financial institution
    - wants to improve account management practices
    - to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches
- Control implementation
    1. Implement centralized user account management system

    - wants to secure its network
    - to protect sensitive patient data and comply with regulatory requirements
- Control implementation
    1. Deploy FW at ingress and egress
    1. Implement IDS/IPS
        - Monitor traffic and detect threats in realtime
    1. Segment network traffic
        - Segment based on use

#### Case studies and implementation 3
- Multinational tech company
    - wants to improve its incident response capability
    - to effectively respond to cybersecurity incidents
- Control implementation
    1. Develop Incident response plan
        - define roles, responsibiliies and communication protocols
    1. Conduct tabletop exercise
        - rehearse scenarios with stakeholders
    1. Establish incident response team

    
#### Case studies and implementation 4
- Software dev company
    - wants to enhance the security of its application and identify vulnerabilities before deployment
- Control implementation
    1. Perform code reviews and testing
        - integrate processes into the SDLC
    1. Conduct pentesting
        - Internal and external pentesters
    1. Adopt secure coding practices
        - Train developers




## Chapter 3 - Risk management and assessment
### Understanding the risk management framework within NIST SP 800-53
- Objective of RMS - manage cybersecurity risk & ensure compliance
- Key concepts
    - Security controls, authority to operate and continuous monitoring
- Role of risk management
    - Reduce risk
    - Improve security posture
- NIST 800-53 r5 updates
    - Integration of privacy
    - New security controls
    - De-emphasis on FIPS 199
- 7 steps of NIST RMF
    1. Prepare
    1. Categorize
    1. Select security controls
    1. Implement security controls
    1. Assess security controls
    1. Authorize information system
    1. Monitor security controls
- Benefits
    - Standardised approach
    - Comprehensive - complete set of guidelines
    - Customisable - Can be tailored to fit the organisation
- Risk = $ \Sigma^{Threat}_{Threats}\ Threat \times Vulnerability \times Impact$
    - Threat: The potential for harm by an attacker
        - Unauthorized individual getting access to assets
    - Vulnerability: Exploitable weakness in the system
        - Inadequate security measures in place for the server room
    - Impact: the adverse effect on organisational operations, assets and resources
        - Eg. Loss of data, disruption


### Overview of Risk Assessment Methodologies and Tools
- Risk Assessment Methodologies
    - Risk assessment process
        - Framing, assessing, responding and monitoring risk
    - Risk model
        - Define key terms, assess risk factors, relationship among factors
    - Risk Assessment appproach
        - Quantitative / Qualitative / Semi quantitative
        - Specifies values for risk factors
        - Specifies ho values can be combined to evaluate risk
    - Risk analysis approach
        - Threat oriented / asset / impact oriented
        - Graph based analysis and multioriented analysis
